          It is my life experience which has made me who I am, a unique
          individual and a small a part of a diverse world.
        </p>
        <p>
          My undergraduate studies in Electronics Engineering, thus far, have
          seen me prepare myself, for my next steps. In China, Belgium and
          Spain, I keep improving myself in multicultural environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I'm ready to explore a bigger world, to make great high-tech
          products, to build a bridge between people from different cultures,
          and ultimately to make peopleâ€™s lives better.
        </p>
